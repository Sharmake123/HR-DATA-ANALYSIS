# HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a human resources dataset to understand the factors that contribute to employee attrition. The primary goal is to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key insights and then build a predictive model that can classify whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

This project is valuable for any organization looking to reduce employee turnover by understanding its root causes and proactively identifying at-risk employees.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `HR Dataset.csv`, which contains a wide range of information about employees.

**Key features in the dataset include:**

* **Demographic Info:** `Age`, `Gender`, `Marital Status`
* **Job-Related Info:** `Department`, `Job Role`, `Job Level`, `Monthly Income`, `Job Satisfaction`
* **Company-Related Info:** `Years At Company`, `Total Working Years`, `Years Since Last Promotion`
* **Behavioral Info:** `Business Travel`, `Over Time`, `Work Life Balance`
* **Target Variable:** `Attrition` (Yes/No)

## 3. Project Goals

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and transform data into a suitable format for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset to answer key questions:
    * What is the overall attrition rate?
    * Which departments or job roles have the highest turnover?
    * How do factors like age, monthly income, and job satisfaction correlate with attrition?
    * Do employees who work overtime have a higher attrition rate?
* **Data Visualization:** Create insightful charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, histograms, heatmaps) to visualize the findings from the EDA.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict employee attrition based on the available features.
* **Feature Importance:** Identify the most significant factors that influence an employee's decision to leave.

## 4. Tools and Technologies

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
    * **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
    * **Numerical Computation:** NumPy
    * **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
    * **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn

## 5. How to Use

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. You can generate one using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the libraries.)*

4.  **Run the analysis:**
    * The primary analysis and model building will be in a Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) or a Python script.

## 7. Key Findings (To be filled out after analysis)

* *Example: The attrition rate is highest among employees in the 'Sales Representative' role.*
* *Example: Employees who work overtime are significantly more likely to leave the company.*
* *Example: Monthly income below $3000 is strongly correlated with a higher probability of attrition.*

## 8. Model Performance (To be filled out after modeling)

* **Model Used:** Logistic Regression / Random Forest Classifier
* **Accuracy:** XX%
* **Precision:** XX%
* **Recall:** XX%
* **F1-Score:** XX%
